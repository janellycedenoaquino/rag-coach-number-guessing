# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?
- What did the game look like the first time you ran it?
The first time i ran my code it looked fine but had many errors. 
  

- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start
  (for example: "the secret number kept changing" or "the hints were backwards").
- [x] When i guess a number while checking the developer debug info it said go lower for a number that was not lower than the secret.
  - [x] When i said a number higher than the secret it said go higher.
  - inside the Developer Debug Info:
      - [ ] the score says -5 instead of -10 for 2 failed attempts
      - [ ] the History doesn't show the first attempt
      - [ ] attempts are accurate inside of the developer debug info but not on the title where it says "Guess a number between 1 and 100. Attempts left: 5" attempts left is always 5.
  - [ ] allows negative numbers to be added as a guess (should only be between the range)
  - [ ] new game button does not work
  - [ ] attempts start at 1 not 0
  - [x] easy should be from 1-20
  - [ ] normal should be 1-50
  - [ ] hard should be from 1-100
  - [x] should normal be 8 attempts? easy be 6 and hard be 5?
  - [ ] title says "Guess a number between 1 and 100. attemots left: " for all of them.

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

- Which AI tools did you use on this project (for example: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)? ClaudeAI
- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was correct (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result). 
AI suggested to change the tests I had for the "test_winning_guess()" function. the variable we had with the result was a tuple. instead of storing it as a tuple AI suggested we store it in two different variables and use the assert with the value we needed. before i accepted double checked by checking what the function returned and it does return a tuple. so i accepted the changes and my tests pass.

- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was incorrect or misleading (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result). 
When i gave ai the command to move the check_guess to logic_utils.py it didn't find the method inside of app.py so it skipped that step entirely and gave me only suggestions to code the logic inside of logic_utils.py skipping my request entirely.

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- How did you decide whether a bug was really fixed?
- Describe at least one test you ran (manual or using pytest)  
  and what it showed you about your code.

  I ran the app and tested it manually. i also read the tests and made sure that they were passing and correct. ex: for the issue where the suggestion was to go higher when it should be lower. I wrote smaller numbers and ensure the suggestion was to go higher not lower and wrote larger numbers than the target and checked it said go lower. 

- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?
yes AI helped me write the test for the function "test_check_guess_requires_int_secret()" it also made sure we didn't need to cast the value to an int to be able to compare it. it fixed that error.

## 4. What did you learn about Streamlit and state?

- In your own words, explain why the secret number kept changing in the original app.
- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?
- What change did you make that finally gave the game a stable secret number?

## 5. Looking ahead: your developer habits

- What is one habit or strategy from this project that you want to reuse in future labs or projects?
  - This could be a testing habit, a prompting strategy, or a way you used Git.
- What is one thing you would do differently next time you work with AI on a coding task?
- In one or two sentences, describe how this project changed the way you think about AI generated code.
